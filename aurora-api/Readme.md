# API-Schema 

We used [swagger.io](http://http://swagger.io/) and [swaggerhub.com](http://swaggerhub.com) to create the API and the client libaries. 

To edit the API-Schema please edit the schema in swagger-hub. If you press save or publish the file will automatically commit to this repository. 
 
* [API-Schema online editor](https://swaggerhub.com/api/B-Stefan/CheckAuroa-API-Schema/dev)

After you saved your changes push follow the [deploy instructions](./../Readme.md). 

## Create client libs 
The client libs will be automaticly created if you push to heroku-live. This take a wihle, so wait for a few minutes and try to download the client-libs again. 

To create the libs **local** you can use the gulp-tasks see  [Gulp-Tasks](./../gulp/).
